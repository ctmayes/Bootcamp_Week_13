# Venture Funding with Deep Learning

This program is designed to analyze the company's financial and user data in clever ways to make the company grow. So, you want to find out if the ability to predict search traffic can translate into the ability to successfully trade the stock.

## Technologies

Within this program, we will make use of the following external python modules:

  -- pandas
  -- holoviews
  -- fbprophet
  -- hvplot.pandas
  -- datetime
  -- numpy

  
  Additionally, this program was created within a python v3.7 build, and its relevant dependencies.

## Installation Guide

To utilize this program, within your terminal you will have to install the required libraries. Within your terminal, input the following commands:

```python
pip install pystan
```

```python
pip install fbprophet
```

```python
pip install hvplot
```

```python
pip install holoviews
```

At the beginning of the *forecasting_net_prophet.ipynb* file, the technologies are calling in with this code:

```
import pandas as pd
import holoviews as hv
from fbprophet import Prophet
import hvplot.pandas
import datetime as dt
%matplotlib inline
import numpy as np
```

## Usage

This program was created utilizing Google Colab, and will work best when run within that framework within a Chrome browser. If you should like to do it another way, here is an alternative:

To operate this program, open up your terminal of choice and navigate to the directory in which you have downloaded the files within this repository. Open Jupyter Lab with the command: 

```python
jupyter lab
```  

This should open jupyter lab to the filepath in which you have the repo file, and you simply need double click the *forecasting_net_prophet.ipynb* file to open it. Upon opening, select the menu button with two right facing arrows at the top of the notebook, which will run the entire file. It will ask you to confirm you wish to restart the file, to which you will confirm. Wait a few moments for the program to operate as intended, and peruse the resulting data at your leisure. If you wish, simply skip to the end for my analysis of the preceding information.
